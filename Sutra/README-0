In this directory is the code for RRL Version 2.1.
You can use this with Franz Lisp or Common Lisp (KCL, IBCL, Symbolics).

Installing consists of 2 steps.

1) Compiling the code first.

  On Unix systems this can be done by typing one of the following:

   build franz   (for Franz Lisp)
   build kcl     (for KCL)
   build ibcl    (for IBCL)

  On the Symbolics (first copy the code to *.lisp instead of *.lsp)
  and then (load "system")

Compiling takes an hour on a Sun-3 with IBCL.
Check the file compile.out for compiler messages.

2) Starting RRL after compiling.

   Start Lisp and then type:
     (load "system")   ;to load the compiled code
     (start-rrl)       ; to start RRL. (in Common Lisp)
