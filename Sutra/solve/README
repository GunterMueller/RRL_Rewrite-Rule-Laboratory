This directory has the files for Equation Solver. The current
version contains all the changes after the first version.

Improtant changes made till date are :-

    1.. A function has been written which when called shows all
    the available rules. The user has the option of removing
    some of these rules from the set used for restructuring.
    This has to be done by calling :-
    RRL>> (SHOW-RES-RULES $RULE-SET).

    2.. If required the EAGER REWRITING flag can be set off.
    (The default is ON - i.e. eager rewriting is tried). This
    is handled by using a global variable *EAGER-REWRITE* which
    is initially set to T (true). If this flag is set to false
    then eager-rewriting is turned off.
