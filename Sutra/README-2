This directory contains version 1.0 of SUTRA
which is RRL converted to work with Common Lisp also.
Instructions are given below for buliding RRL.
See other README-? files for more information/changes
if the instructions below are not sufficient. 

You can use this with Franz Lisp or
Common Lisp (KCL, IBCL, Allegro, Lucid, Symbolics).

Installing consists of 2 steps.

1) Compiling the code first.

  On Unix systems this can be done by typing:

   build LISP-NAME

where LISP-NAME is  one of franz, kcl, ibcl, allegro, lucid.

  On the Symbolics (first copy the code to *.lisp instead of *.lsp)
  and then (load "rrl")

Compiling takes about an hour on a Sun-3 with KCL.

Note: you may wish to redirect output of build to some file
      and background it by using   
             build kcl > compile.out &


2) Starting RRL after compiling.

   Start Lisp and then type:
     (load "rrl")   ;to load the compiled code
     (start-rrl)       ; to start RRL. (in Common Lisp)

If you have a lot of disk-space (4 Meg or so) you can
save an image of RRL using (save "File-name") in kcl
or "dumplisp" or some such construct to avoid step 2 each time.
But loading the files takes only a couple of minutes.

If you wish to use RRL from some other directory than where
this code is, (for example if the code is in /usa/rrl)
then before loading rrl.lsp do 
 (setq *rrl-directory*  "/usa/rrl/") before the
 (load "/usa/rrl") and then
 (start-rrl)

==========
When using RRL, if it ever breaks and goes back to Lisp top-level,
use (resume-rrl) to get back to RRL.
