;; PROBLEM 7:  A ring in which x * x * x = x is commutative.
  (x + y) == (y + x)
  (x + y) + z == x + (y + z)
  (x + 0) == x
  (x + i(x)) == 0
  ((x * y) * z) == (x * (y * z))
  (x * (y + z)) == ((x * y) + (x * z))
  (x + y) * z == (x * z) + (y * z)
  (x * i(y)) == i(x * y)
  (x * x * x) == x

  (a * b) != (b * a)
