RRL (Rewrite Rule Laboratory) is an interactive reasoning program based on 
rewriting techniques and is developed by the authors during the last six years.
This manual is intended to introduce the reader to RRL as a theorem
prover: The proof methods supported by RRL are outlined with examples;
the commands of RRL are grouped by their functionality and are described 
in detail. Transcripts of a number of examples which were run on RRL are 
included to illustrate the capabilities and features of RRL 
as a theorem prover.
